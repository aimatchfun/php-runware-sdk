## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-08

### Changed (Breaking)
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `ModelAir` enum to `RunwareModel`
  - All references to `ModelAir` must be updated to `RunwareModel`
  - Example: `ModelAir::REAL_DREAM_SDXL_PONY_14` → `RunwareModel::REAL_DREAM_SDXL_PONY_14`
  - Updated all method signatures that accepted `ModelAir` to accept `RunwareModel`
  - Updated documentation and examples
- Fixed incorrect references to `FluxScheduler` in documentation (should be `Scheduler`)
- Default `clipSkip` value changed from 1 to 0
- Default `width` and `height` values changed from 512 to 1024

### Internal
- Reorganized source code into subdirectories for better structure:
  - `src/Enums/` - Contains all enum classes (RunwareModel, Scheduler, OutputType, etc.)
  - `src/Services/` - Contains service classes (TextToImage, RunwareImageUpload)
  - `src/Models/` - Contains model/value object classes (RunwareResponse, Refiner, ControlNet, etc.)
- Updated autoload configuration in `composer.json` to support new directory structure using classmap
- Fixed `ControlNet` class definition (was incorrectly defined as enum, now properly defined as class)

### Fixed
- Synchronized `composer.lock` with `composer.json` dependencies

## [1.0.0] - 2025-03-11
