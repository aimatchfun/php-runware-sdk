## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- New `ImageUpload` service class for uploading images to Runware API
  - Supports multiple image formats: URLs, base64 strings, and data URIs
  - Returns image UUID for use in other operations (e.g., inpainting)
  - Includes async support via `runAsync()` method
  - Comprehensive documentation and examples in README

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-11

### Added
- `model()` method in `TextToImage` and `Inpainting` classes now accepts both `RunwareModel` enum and string values (AIR format), providing more flexibility when specifying models

## [2.0.2] - 2025-12-08

### Fixed

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-08

### Changed (Breaking)
- **BREAKING**: Renamed `ModelAir` enum to `RunwareModel`
  - All references to `ModelAir` must be updated to `RunwareModel`
  - Example: `ModelAir::REAL_DREAM_SDXL_PONY_14` → `RunwareModel::REAL_DREAM_SDXL_PONY_14`
  - Updated all method signatures that accepted `ModelAir` to accept `RunwareModel`
  - Updated documentation and examples
- Fixed incorrect references to `FluxScheduler` in documentation (should be `Scheduler`)
- Default `clipSkip` value changed from 1 to 0
- Default `width` and `height` values changed from 512 to 1024

### Internal
- Reorganized source code into subdirectories for better structure:
  - `src/Enums/` - Contains all enum classes (RunwareModel, Scheduler, OutputType, etc.)
  - `src/Services/` - Contains service classes (TextToImage, RunwareImageUpload)
  - `src/Models/` - Contains model/value object classes (RunwareResponse, Refiner, ControlNet, etc.)
- Updated autoload configuration in `composer.json` to support new directory structure using classmap
- Fixed `ControlNet` class definition (was incorrectly defined as enum, now properly defined as class)

### Fixed
- Synchronized `composer.lock` with `composer.json` dependencies

## [1.0.0] - 2025-03-11

### Added
- Creation of textToImage, imageToImage, inpainting and outpainting functions
